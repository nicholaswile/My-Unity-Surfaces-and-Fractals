# Unity-CPU-GPU-Gems
Various C#/HLSL samples for Unity with a focus on computer graphics. Includes my implementations of Jasper Flick's demos from <a href="https://catlikecoding.com/">Catlike Coding</a>. I'm calling this CPU GPU Gems because some of the code executes on the CPU, and other code executes on the GPU. It's a nod towards NVIDIA's <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/contributors">GPU Gems</a> series of books on computer graphics.

TODO: Add Gif for each scene and brief description, with performance gains and link to code folders. Maybe include screenshots of frame rates.
